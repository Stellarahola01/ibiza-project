		<h2> History </h2>

		<p> The first inhabitants were Iberians, during the Bronze era. Throughout history the island has been in the hands of  Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, pirates, Romans, etc. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it was annexed to the North African Empire. It was taken over by the Byzantines in 554 (the remaining Roman Empire). Ibiza was ruled by Muslims under the Califate of Cordoba and later of Denia. The island was named Jebisah from 902 until 1229, when it reached its economic peak. The island was taken by the Crown of Aragon in 1235, envtually becoming part of the Kingdom of Spain.  </p>


	<p>From 1960 onwards, a frantic tourist expansion began in Ibiza, which had its own individuality, with the hippie movement, and would eventually lead to a youthful and discotheque tourism, with Ibiza being Europe's center of young partying.</p>

	<h2> Traditions: Ball Pagès </h2> 
	<p>The word "ball pages" refers to a collection of Balearic Islands' traditional dances. They are dances from rural community that have a clear distinction between men and women's roles. The woman moves with extremely short, fast steps in circles within which the male acts, with her arms contained in her body and her gaze fixed on the floor rather than the dancer. The guy, on the other hand, has no set moves and dances by leaping and tossing his legs up in the air, trying to follow the dancer's eyes but never turning his back on her. </p>

	<h2> Gastronomy </h2> 
	<p>TThe typical food of Ibiza is not well known beyond the island itself. Ibizan cuisine shares the same essence, ingredients and preparation methods as the cuisines of the other Balearic Islands. However, let us not forget that the islands' ancestral isolation has led to the development of their own particularities. In the case of Ibiza, these culinary singularities are truly succulent. The following dishes consist of Bullit de peix, Sofrit Pagès, Borrida de Ratjada, Grexionera, Flaó, Orelletes, Arroç de Matances, Cuinat and Frita de Pulpo. </p>
